1. last night i was "codign" until 1am, but i do not think what i was writing code in the usual sense, beacuse i was too much focus on the samll details,such as the IDE environment is not perfect, the terminal is not elegent enough,the desktop is not neat ,etc,which wasted a lot of my time and patience,i can not concentrate fully on the really important thing,etc,debug.

2. i looked at the python requests library source code today and fond a huge gap between myself and these code contributors , include code normalization and code structure,etc.
