- Last night i was "coding" until 1am, but i do not think what i was writing code in the usual sense, beacuse i was too much focus on the small details,such as the IDE environment is not perfect, the terminal is not elegent enough,the desktop is not neat ,etc,which wasted a lot of my time and patience,i can not concentrate fully on the really important thing-debug.
